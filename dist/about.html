                <p>Hi, my name is Omar Cobas! I’m an aspiring computer engineer 
                    / computer scientist passionate about coding, video game 
                    development, web development and much much more. If you meet me,
                    I'm quiet at first, but after a while we might just become best friends...</p>

                    <h3>Where am I from?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was born in Bronx, NY but both of my parents are 
                        Cuban immigrants. From them, and school, I learned Spanish.
                        Since most of my family still lives in Cuba, sadly I 
                        don’t see them often. 
                    </p>
            </div>
 <div class="job job-3">
                <h3>What are my hobbies?</h3>
                <p>Besides coding I like to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch anime! Anime is love, anime is life. I spend a lot 
                        of time analyzing then plot of popular and niche anime. 
                        In college, I intend on joining an anime club</li>
                    <li>In that same vein, I like to read manga! I’ve read quite a 
                        few manga, some of my favorite are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>One Piece</li>
                            <li>Naruto</li>
                            <li>One Punch Man</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>I like to play video games! I mostly play on PC, but I also
                    play on console.</li>
                    <li>I love to learn cool, random things. I’ve spent so many 
                        weekends watching YouTube on the most random of things 
                        ranging from Psychology to Ethical Hacking. I treat YouTube
                        as a main source of knowledge!</li>
                    <li>I hang out (and sometimes Skype) friends and family. We 
                        discuss, laugh, and fight with each other</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="job job-2">
                <h3>My goals:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To only work on things I find cool</li>
                    <li>To build applications that makes people lives easier</li>
                    <li>To help those who have limited access to technology</li>
                </ul>
